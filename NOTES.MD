## NOTES

### Pinned Locations

- Store names of cities in Local Storage
- Get them out and do fetch req for each one to give current weather conditions
- Update as soon as pin is clicked

rather than the pin button toggling pinned state, make the pinned location button trigger a different function that just finds that city in the state/local storage and removes it/filters it.
